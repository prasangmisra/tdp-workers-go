When I change computer from prod to local :
VS execution:
1. Start from TLD loop package
2. Check VS environment - local
3. Change tdp_ado connection in TLD loop package
4. Desable  container with parameters, enable container with variables
5. If I need to execute only enom_dm package I need to enter passwords to enom_dm package parameters

cmd execution
1. delete parameters  for tdp_ado connection in TLD loop package
2. Change tdp_ado connection in TLD loop package
3. Biuld and copy to folder ssis_local

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I transfer  data from ITDP TO TDP without filter by domain status_id - all records by TLD

2. I take information thin\thick TLD from TDP  - it should be enter with correct value in TDP before migration start

3. Before migration start
- list tld with information thin\thick   from Vilma
- tdp should be populte correct with accredittion and tenant customer info for each TLD
- tld.dns.min_nameservers
- tld.lifecycle.domain_length
- tld.lifecycle.add_grace_period
- tld.lifecycle.transfer_grace_period
- tld.lifecycle.redemption_grace_period
- Enom validation 
  domain without contact
  domain without nameservers  or <min_nameservers
  domain without expiration date
  domain with wrong email
  domain with wrong country code
  domain with address1=null
  domain with city=null

  4. for executing package with config file  from cmd line:
  DTExec.exe /Project "Enom_dm.ispac" /Package "package.dtsx" /ConfigFile "Enom_dm_dev.dtsConfig"
  DTExec.exe /Project "Enom_dm.ispac" /Package "package.dtsx" /ConfigFile "Enom_dm_local.dtsConfig"

  values in config file works only when it is additional parameter,
  which was not used when package was built. a redefining parameter does not work

  for creating config file :
  - control flow - property -misc-configuration 
  - add configuratin xml file.
  - before build package - disable all config files
  if not disable config file before build package - config file which is defined in cmd does not work.

  if enable config file - you can export some value or add new to exiting config file.
  if execute package in VS  with config file enabled - you did not get value from config file on the disk , you will get just current value from package.
  
  for make config file workable for define connectionString  in cmd - don't parameterize connection string in connection manager inthe package.
